# 🚗 Self Driving Car Game

A browser-based self-driving car simulation game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 
This project demonstrates how basic car mechanics, artificial sensors, collision detection, traffic simulation, and neural networks can be used together to create a simple autonomous car simulation in the browser.
